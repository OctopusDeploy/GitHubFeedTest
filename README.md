# GitHubFeedTest
A test repository for proving GitHub releases can be used as a feed in Octopus.

**Please for the love of spaghetti and marine animals: don't mess with this repo!**

This is the E2E test: https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/OctopusDeploy/blob/master/source/Octopus.E2ETests.API/Scripts/PackageFeeds/DeployPackageFromGitHubFeedTestScript.cs

It depends on the latest release being `1.0.0`: https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/GitHubFeedTest/releases/tag/1.0.0
